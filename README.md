+ Seismic Analysis and Buildings design - NCSE02. The approach for this project was to study the SDOF and MDOF models over some buildings within the NCSE-02 legal concerns.
+ Hydrologic study and statistical Analysis - Anzur river. Learn about the methods used on a standard hydrologic study in Spain and study the gap from reality for each method. Determine the best outcome creating an alternative model based on the historic data of the Anzur River (South Spain).
